# 1. Reliable, Scalable, Maintainable App

A data-intensive app is typically built from standard building blocks that provides commonly needed functionality:
- Store data - database
- Remember result of operation - cached
- allow user to search data - search indexes
- send message to another process - stream processing
- Periodically handle large amount of accumulated data - batch processing

The 3 main concerns that are important in most applications:
- Reliability: work correctly at desired performance
- Scalability: Reasonable way to scale the app existed
- Maintainability: People joined the project should be able to work on it productively

## Reliability
