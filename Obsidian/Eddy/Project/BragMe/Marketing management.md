### Friday, Jan 16

- [x] **POST (6am GMT+7 / 6pm Jan 15 EST)** - Tweet 1.6: BIP difficulty (honest moment)
  ```
  Honest moment:

  Everyone says "just code 1 hour after work."

  But after 8 hours of Zoom, Slack, and debugging prod...

  That 1 hour feels like climbing Everest in flip-flops.

  The hustle culture advice doesn't mention the exhaustion part.
  ```

- [x] **POST (9pm GMT+7 / 9am Jan 16 EST)** - Tweet 1.7: Balance question (math doesn't math)
  ```
  Trying to figure out the balance:

  Day job: 40hrs (actually 50)
  Side project: Should be 10-15hrs
  Sleep: 56hrs minimum
  Life: ... exists?

  The math doesn't math.

  How are people shipping products with full-time jobs? Genuine question.
  ```

- [x] **POST (10pm GMT+7 / 10am Jan 16 EST)** - Tweet 1.8: Weekend vs rest dilemma (Saturday decision tree)
  ```
  Saturday morning decision tree:

  Option A: Work on side project (guilt-free progress)
  Option B: Touch grass (guilt-ridden rest)
  Option C: Sleep until noon (maximum guilt)

  Why does every option come with guilt?

### Sunday, Jan 18

- [x] **POST (5am GMT+7 / 5pm Jan 18 EST)** - Tweet 1.9: BIP tip (1 meaningful thing)
  ```
  Tried something this week:

  Instead of "1 hour after work," I do "1 meaningful thing."

  Could be:
  - Write 1 function
  - Fix 1 bug
  - Update 1 doc

  Progress > hours logged.

  Day 3. Less guilt. Slightly more commits.
  ```

- [x] **POST (7am GMT+7 / 7pm Jan 18 EST)** - Tweet 1.10: Weekend reflection setup (47 commits)
  ```
  Weekend thought:

  Been working on this side project for 6 months.

  GitHub says 47 commits.

  That's like... 2 commits per week?

  Starting to wonder if "evening exhaustion" is the real blocker, not time management.
  ```

- [ ] **POST (11pm GMT+7 / 11am Jan 19 EST)** - Tweet 1.11: Saturday vulnerable share (rest IS productive)
  ```
  Spent all week looking forward to Saturday coding.

  Saturday arrives.

  Brain: "Remember that 50hr work week? Yeah, I'm taking the day off."

  The side project guilt is real but so is burnout.

  Maybe rest IS productive?

## Week 2: Energy Management (Jan 19-25)

### Monday, Jan 19

- [ ] **POST (2am GMT+7 / 2pm Jan 19 EST)** - Tweet 1.12: Sunday engagement (what did you get done)
  ```
  Sunday question for side project builders:

  What did you actually get done this week?

  No judgment zone. Even "researched for 3hrs" counts.

  I'll start: Refactored 1 component. Felt like moving a mountain.
  ```

  ```
  2am coding sessions felt productive until I spent 3 hours fixing the bug I introduced at 1:45am.

  Turns out: tired brain writes worse code than sober brain writes drunk tweets.

  The hustle myth is expensive.

### Wednesday, Jan 21

- [ ] **POST (12am GMT+7 / 12pm Jan 20 EST)** - Tweet 2.2: BIP energy lesson (can't sprint marathon)
  ```
  Week 1 lesson from building in public:

  You can't sprint a marathon.

  Side projects need sustainable pace, not 3am heroics.

  Progress ≠ exhaustion.

  Small wins today > burnout tomorrow.
  ```

- [ ] **POST (9pm GMT+7 / 9am Jan 21 EST)** - Tweet 2.3: Burnout warning signs
  ```
  Signs you need a break from your side project:

  - Debugging feels personal
  - Caffeine stopped working
  - "Quick fix" took 4 hours
  - You're googling syntax you know by heart
  - Dreaming in error messages

  The side project isn't going anywhere. Neither is your health if you keep this up.

### Thursday, Jan 22

- [ ] **POST (2am GMT+7 / 2pm Jan 21 EST)** - Tweet 2.4: Saturday reality check (weekend delusion)
  ```
  Saturday morning delusion:
  "I'll ship this whole feature today."

  Saturday evening reality:
  - 6 hours coding
  - 12 Stack Overflow tabs
  - 1 working button
  - Entire Sunday needed to recover

  Quality time > quantity time.
  ```

- [ ] **POST (10pm GMT+7 / 10am Jan 22 EST)** - Tweet 2.5: Rest as productivity
  ```
  Honest moment:

  I used to think rest was lazy.

  Took 2 burnouts to learn: rest IS productivity.

  Fresh brain in 2 hours > exhausted brain in 8 hours.

  The code doesn't care how many hours you suffered. It just cares if it works.

### Friday, Jan 23

- [ ] **POST (4am GMT+7 / 4pm Jan 22 EST)** - Tweet 2.6: Hustle culture myth
  ```
  Hustle culture sold us a lie:

  "Real builders code until 3am."

  Actually:
  - Real builders know when to stop
  - Real builders sleep
  - Real builders take breaks
  - Real builders ship quality, not burnout

  Grinding ≠ building.
  ```

- [ ] **POST (8pm GMT+7 / 8am Jan 23 EST)** - Tweet 2.7: Small progress counts
  ```
  Side project truth:

  30 minutes of focused coding beats 3 hours of distracted grinding.

  This week:
  - Mon: 45 min → shipped auth flow
  - Tue: 20 min → fixed critical bug
  - Wed: 0 min → rested (also progress)
  - Thu: 1 hour → new feature

  Consistency > heroics.

### Saturday, Jan 24

- [ ] **POST (1am GMT+7 / 1pm Jan 23 EST)** - Tweet 2.8: Energy tracking observation
  ```
  Started tracking my energy levels, not just my time:

  High energy:
  - Morning (6-10am)
  - Right after exercise

  Low energy:
  - After meetings
  - Late night (obviously)

  Now I code when sharp, rest when tired.

  Revolutionary concept, I know.
  ```

- [ ] **POST (9pm GMT+7 / 9am Jan 24 EST)** - Tweet 2.9: Week 2 energy management update
  ```
  Week 2 of sustainable side project dev:

  New rules I'm following:
  - No code after 9pm (hard stop)
  - Rest days count as progress
  - 1 hour focused > 4 hours distracted
  - If I'm stuck for 30 min, I walk away

  Results: More shipped. Less burnout. Wild.

  Real talk:

  When's the last time you worked on your side project without feeling guilty for NOT working harder?

  □ Never (we need to talk)
  □ Rare (relatable)
  □ Sometimes (progress)
  □ Often (teach me)

  Rest isn't the enemy. Burnout is.
  ```

- [ ] **POST (10pm GMT+7 / 10am Jan 25 EST)** - Tweet 2.11: Saturday vulnerable reflection
  ```
  Saturday truth:

  I took a full rest day yesterday. Zero code.

  Old me: "You're wasting time."
  New me: "You're investing in Monday."

  The guilt is real. But so is the fresh brain I have now.

  Progress isn't just commits. Sometimes it's recovery.

### Monday, Jan 26

- [ ] **POST (11pm GMT+7 / 11am Jan 27 EST)** - Tweet 2.12: Sunday thread (2-week energy learnings)
  ```
  2 weeks of energy-aware side project work. Here's what changed:

  1/ Stopped romanticizing 2am coding. Started valuing 8am fresh brain.

  2/ Rest days aren't failure. They're maintenance.

  3/ Quality hours > total hours. 2 focused hours shipped more than 8 distracted ones.

  4/ Burnout is a bug, not a badge.

  5/ The project doesn't need a hero. It needs consistency.

  Building this way feels sustainable. Maybe that's the whole point.

### Tuesday, Jan 27

- [ ] **POST (8pm GMT+7 / 8am Jan 28 EST)** - Tweet 3.1: 30 minutes is enough
  ```
  Hot take:

  30 minutes of coding before kids wake up > 4 hours of exhausted coding at midnight.

  Sustainable building isn't about hero sprints.

  It's about showing up when your brain actually works.

  Today: 30 min on auth flow. Done. Moving on with my day.

### Friday, Jan 30

- [ ] **POST (4am GMT+7 / 4pm Jan 29 EST)** - Tweet 3.6: Small wins community (subtle hint)
  ```
  Love what I'm seeing in #BuildInPublic:

  "Deployed my first component" → 47 likes
  "Fixed a CSS bug" → people celebrating
  "30 min session done" → genuine support

  Why is it easier to celebrate small wins for strangers than ourselves?

  Maybe we need a way to track our own small wins. Hmm.
  ```

- [ ] **POST (8pm GMT+7 / 8am Jan 30 EST)** - Tweet 3.7: Sustainable pace epiphany
  ```
  Epiphany at 6:47am:

  I've written more code in 3 weeks of 30-min sessions than I did in 6 months of "I'll work on it when I have time."

  Turns out "when I have time" = never.

  Small, scheduled, sustainable > waiting for the perfect 4-hour block.

  Things I didn't do this week:

  ❌ Pull an all-nighter
  ❌ Code for 8 hours straight
  ❌ Skip meals to ship faster
  ❌ Burn out

  Things I did do:

  ✅ Code every day for 30 min
  ✅ Make real progress
  ✅ Still have energy

  Sustainable building isn't sexy. But it works.

  Friday reflection:

  This week I:
  - Wrote 3 new components
  - Fixed 2 bugs
  - Added error handling
  - Learned new React pattern

  But if you asked me Monday what I did last week? I'd say "not much."

  Why do we forget our own progress? How do we remember these small wins?

  (Asking for a friend. The friend is me.)

  ```
  Week 3 of building sustainably. Thread on what I learned:

  1/ 30-minute sessions beat waiting for "the right time." The right time is now. For 30 minutes.

  2/ I shipped more in 3 weeks of consistency than 6 months of "I'll do it when I have energy."

  3/ Small wins compound. 21 sessions × 30 min = 10.5 hours of actual building. That's real progress.

  4/ The hardest part isn't coding. It's remembering what you did. Tracking these wins somehow would be helpful.

  5/ Sustainable > heroic. No burnout. No all-nighters. Just daily progress.

  6/ The #BuildInPublic community celebrates small commits. We should do this for ourselves too.

  Next week: Keep building. Keep showing up. See where this takes me.

  Week 4: When sustainable building revealed a bigger problem.

  Here's what happened:

  1/ Continued 30-second focused sessions. Still avoiding burnout. Energy stable.

  2/ Someone asked "what did you ship this month?" and I... couldn't answer.

  3/ Spent 40 mins reconstructing my wins from git commits. Still missing stuff.

  4/ Tried existing tools: Notes (forgot to use), Notion (too complex), Memory (lol).

  5/ Realized the pattern: I can BUILD in 30 seconds. But I can't TRACK in less than 5 minutes.

  6/ Asked coworkers how they track wins. Nobody does it consistently. Everyone agrees it's important.

  7/ Had a lightbulb moment: What if tracking was as fast as the work itself?

  Week 5 goal: Stop complaining. Start building.

  What if I made a win-tracker that takes <30 seconds to use? Mobile-first. Voice-to-text. Dead simple.

  For me. For you. For everyone forgetting their wins before review season.

  Should I do this?

  Screw it. I'm doing this.

  Saturday 11pm. Still coding.

  Not because I have to.
  Because the notification system is FINALLY working.

  That dopamine hit when the test device buzzes?

  Then I remember: They have a team. I have me.

  Comparison is the thief of joy.

### Tuesday, Feb 24

  ```
  6 weeks building Brag 🧵

  Stats:
  - Lines of code: ~4,000
  - Features killed: 3
  - Features shipped: 7
  - Times I almost quit: 2
  - Hours spent: ~120
  - Revenue: $0

  Biggest lesson: Kill features faster. Pivot sooner.

  Thread on the hardest pivot below 👇
  ```

- [ ] **POST (7:05am GMT+7 / 7:05pm Feb 23 EST)** - Tweet 6.14: Lesson thread (AI pivot story)
  ```
  The hardest pivot:

  I spent 2 weeks building "AI Weekly Digest" — summarizes your wins into a polished paragraph.

  Cool feature. Users loved the idea.

  Problem: $1.50/user/month in AI costs.

  At $4.99 subscription, that's 30% of revenue gone.

  Killed it. Replaced with templates.

  Week 7 of building Brag:

  Users: 10 → 18
  Daily actives: 3 → 7
  Wins logged: 34 → 127
  Bug reports: 12 → 31
  MRR: Still $0

  The bug reports are exhausting.
  But people are USING it. Daily.

  That's not nothing. #BuildInPublic
  ```

- [ ] **POST (9am GMT+7 / 9pm Mar 2 EST)** - Tweet 7.14: Thanking beta testers
  ```
  Shoutout to my 18 beta testers.

  You're using a buggy app with missing features and terrible dark mode.

  And you still log wins daily.

  Y'all are the real ones.

  First paying users get lifetime discount. Bet on it.

  Day 50 of building Brag.

  What started as "why can't I remember my wins?" is now:

  - A working app
  - 20+ beta users
  - 150+ wins logged
  - Real people finding real value

  Still $0 revenue. But the foundation is there.

  50 more days to launch. Let's go. #BuildInPublic

  That's ~60 days to:
  - Squash remaining bugs
  - Add payment flow
  - Build landing page
  - Prep App Store assets

  Scary. Excited. Mostly scared.

  Hard decision today:

  Feature freeze until launch.

  No new features for 60 days. Only:
  - Bug fixes
  - Performance
  - Polish

  It's tempting to add "one more thing."

  But shipping > perfecting.

  Pricing for Brag:

  Option A: Free forever (grow fast, monetize later?)
  Option B: $2.99/mo (affordable, covers costs)
  Option C: Freemium (3 free wins/week, $4.99 unlimited)

  Leaning Option C.

  8 weeks of building in public. Here's what I learned:

  1. Post the failures. They get more engagement than wins.
  2. Ask for help. People want to help.
  3. Consistency > virality.
  4. Your first users ARE your marketing team.
  5. $0 MRR is fine if daily actives are growing.

  Thread 🧵
  ```

- [ ] **POST (9:05pm GMT+7 / 9:05am Mar 6 EST)** - Tweet 8.8: Thread continuation (part 2)
  ```
  6. Kill features faster. Sunk cost is real.
  7. Charge early, even if it's $1.
  8. Twitter followers ≠ paying users.
  9. Build in public isn't free marketing. It's accountability.
  10. The "about to quit" moments are normal. Push through.

  Day 53. Still building.
