# Warm up strategy
## Day 1
- Scroll 5 mins per account, 2x/day on 'For you page'
- Watch vids till the end ( important)
## Day 2
- Scroll 5 mins per account, 2x/day on 'For you page'
- Watch vids till the end ( important)
- Like in your exact niche
- Follow 5-10 revelant accounts
- DO NOT POST ANYTHING

## Day 3 - 5
- search keywords + vids in the niche ( filter last 3 months)
- Like + comment under videos
- Target exact audience type
> Goal: trick algo thinking you're the user type you want to reach

Once revelant content starts showing on fyp ( after 2, 3 days of warmup)

Post a high-engagement image + text overlay in the niche

> note: must be a post with proven traction AND comments (controversy drives interaction)

> Rules after for 1st post: 
> ```
> Switch to Daily Warmup Checklist to keep account primed
new accounts = at least 6 posts (2/day) after phase 2
if account dips unhealthy (<300 views on 6+ vids) → post 3x phone-native vids (can revive it)
if it still doesn’t recover after 6 tries → ditch and restart
> ```
