    **which goes viral on tiktok**
    
    people keep asking me how we’re cranking out ai ugc at scale
    
    well, here’s the full playbook i use (and yes i’m plugging my bestie's tool because it’s the best i’ve seen - say hi
    
    [@zeeshaanl](https://x.com/zeeshaanl)
    
    )
    
    (i know VEO is good, but it's clips are tagged with SynthID, which tiktok detects and flags - already tested)
    
    **step 1 – sign up**
    
    ![👉](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f449.svg)
    
    go to theinfluencer. ai
    
    ![👉](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f449.svg)
    
    pick a plan:
    • $39 = upload your own pics, build your own influencer
    • $99 = 10s video gen (cheaper plans = 5s only)
    
    **step 2 – craft your influencer**
    
    3 ways:
    • create your own → pick traits until you like the look
    • upload your own → 5+ pics, set “age” carefully, it changes results
    • premade → unlimited use, no training credits spent
    
    tip: don’t settle. regen until it feels right.
    
    **step 3 – generate photos**
    
    your influencer trains in ~5 min. then:
    • aspect ratio = 9:16 (tiktok / reels / shorts standard)
    • prompts = keep it clean:
    frame + light + camera + where + wear + action/expression + tone/finish
    
    examples:
    - half-body, golden hour, 26mm smartphone, kitchen, neutral sweater, candid smile, warm film look
    - headshot, overcast daylight, 28mm smartphone, balcony, light jacket, gentle smile, natural skin texture
    
    tip: 1 idea per slot. keyword soup = trash outputs.
    
    **step 4 – edit & add products**
    
    google’s “nano banana” model = magic.
    - click “combine images with ai” → drop in product, clothing, jewelry.
    - click “edit photo” → rewrite anything you don’t like with a text prompt.
    
    **step 5 – generate videos**
    
    videos start from a still photo.
    click → “create video”.
    
    use this prompt formula:
    camera + micro-action + secondary motion + background + pace + vibe
    
    examples:
    – gentle handheld sway, tiny push-in, soft blinking, hair flutter, subtle bokeh drift, calm pace, warm daylight
    – slow left pan, small head turn, relaxed smile, fabric ripple, shallow parallax, cozy indoor feel
    
    tip: don’t describe appearance again. the photo already locked the look. focus on motion only.
    
    **step 6 – lip sync (optional, if you want to make them talk)**
    
    • select “lip sync & details”
    • in your video prompt, add “the person is talking” for best results
    • pick a voice + script. match length to video (5s vs 10s).
    
    ![🌟](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f31f.svg)
    
    done → you have a talking ai influencer.
    
    this is literally the exact workflow we use to pump out ugc that looks real enough to pass.
    
    don’t overcomplicate prompts, don’t try to stuff 10 ideas into one line. clean slots = clean outputs.

    “an, i’m not getting traction. i think my account is shadowbanned”
    
    after 50m+ views, here’s the exact diagnostic framework i use
    
    ![👇🏽](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f447-1f3fd.svg)
    
    <300 views → shadowban
    if you're consistently seeing less than 300 views over 6 posts or more, do an account health diagnosis. recommend warmup post 2 (check my highlights). 
    
    300-800 views → hook failure
    your first 5s suck. don’t touch anything else until you fix this. rework angle, visual, text, sound - everything.
    
    800–2K views → content quality issue
    the hook worked, but your story didn’t. people clicked, but they didn’t stay. focus on storytelling + deliver more value.
    
    2K–10K views → engagement problem
    you made good content, but it didn’t spark emotion/engagement. test formats that are funny, relatable, or novel. people share what aligns with who they are - or who they want to be.
    
    10K+ views → gold
    you found the formula. double down, replicate fast, keep the style and just tweak details. spark the post.
    
    if you’re stuck at <800 views → it’s the hook. full stop.
    don’t waste time on CTAs. don’t stress about product presentation.
    
    fix. the. hook.
    
    retention curves will tell you everything. if the line flattens, you’ve nailed it. use the VSC framework to find your initial inspiration (in comments

    tiktok farming lesson #2 (updated w/ warmup ph 2)
    
    “do you really need to warm up new accounts?”
    
    some say no - just scroll for 15 min, follow 5 people, start posting.
    
    some say do proper warmup for 7 days+.
    
    we tested both across 50+ accounts. instant same day post vs proper warmup.
    
    ![👉🏽](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f449-1f3fd.svg)
    
    the accounts we warmed up properly → higher % of consistently healthy, longer survival.
    
    here’s our 5-day warmup strategy
    
    ![👇🏽](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f447-1f3fd.svg)
    
    ![🕐](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f550.svg)
    
    days 1–2: become a lurker
    
    - scroll 5 min per account, 2x/day on fyp
    - watch vids till the end (this matters)
    - like in your exact niche
    - follow 5–10 relevant accounts (initally tiktok doesn't let you follow, but it'll open up on day 2, 3)
    
    ![❌](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/274c.svg)
    
    do not post anything
    
    ![🕐](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f550.svg)
    
    days 3–5: warmup phase 1 (get strategic)
    
    - search keywords + vids in your niche (filter last 3 months)
    - like + comment under videos (mimic real user behavior)
    - target your exact audience type
    --> fitness app? fill your feed with

    if account dips unhealthy (<300 views on 6+ vids) → post 3x phone-native vids (can revive it)
    
    if it still doesn’t recover after 6 tries → ditch and restart

    TikTok farming lesson #17
    
    Shortform scripts → add $10K/mo to your app.
    
    Attention spans are low. We need to capture and maintain the audience’s attention quickly.  You won’t have time to use all the strategies to create an engaging script, so use what is appropriate for your offer and ICP.
    
    Here’s what works:
    
    ![1️⃣](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/31-20e3.svg)
    
    Hook hard - bold claim, surprising stat, or provocative Q. Stop the scroll first, sell later.
    
    ![2️⃣](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/32-20e3.svg)
    
    Keep it tight - no fluff. The script is concise, clear and impactful. Every extra word = drop-off.
    
    ![3️⃣](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/33-20e3.svg)
    
    Hit pain points early - acknowledge their struggles or desired right from the beginning because you’ll establish relevance and create a connection with them.
    
    ![4️⃣](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/34-20e3.svg)
    
    Urgency - FOMO in the first 3s. Communicate with the viewer they will miss out on something valuable or important if they don’t continue watching.
    
    ![5️⃣](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/35-20e3.svg)
    
    Story > script – Everyone loves stories. Your stories are conveyed through your script, not the video content. The video content is for visual stimulation, the script is for the story telling.
    
    ![6️⃣](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/36-20e3.svg)
    
    Talk like a buddy – simple, casual, raw. Use easy words and be clear. You want everyone to understand and enjoy your video.
    
    ![7️⃣](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/37-20e3.svg)
    
    Power words – Powerful words hooks your audience’s attention. These are some words that you can use in your own script: “unreal, brutal, shocking, game-changer, impactful, magical, breathless, unforgettable”
    
    ![8️⃣](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/38-20e3.svg)
    
    Humor - a quick laugh = higher shares.
    
    ![9️⃣](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/39-20e3.svg)
    
    Teach something - authority + virality = long-term leverage.
    
    ![🔟](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f51f.svg)
    
    CTA - if you want the follow/download, ask without being salesly.
    
    Example frameworks:
    
    #1
    Hook: “I used to skip workouts 3x a week.”
    Solution: “This app guilt-texts me until I train. Now I never miss.”
    
    #2
    Hook: “70% of people never fix their posture.”
    Solution: “Backed fixed mine in 10 minutes a day.”
    
    #3
    Hook: "Did you know 85% of women lose hair by age 30?"  Solution: "This spray saved my hair—and my confidence."
    
    #4
    Hook: "I was tired of losing track of my spending."  Solution: "This app automatically organizes my finances in seconds."
    
    #5
    Hook: “Why do most LDRs die in year 1?”
    Question: “How do you make it past that?”
    Solution: “Flamme gives couples daily rituals to actually last.”
    
    Steal these, plug your product, and test.

    TikTok farming lesson #16
    
    Sharing the VSC framework we use to pick viral clips which convert, which we can recreate.
    
    Most people post blindly. We don’t.
    
    Every clip we choose runs through this filter:
    
    ![▪️](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/25aa.svg)
    
    V = Virality
    
    Has this content gone viral before?
    
    Here’s how we check:
    1. Make sure it didn’t come from a account with a lot of followers (otherwise it’s just follower reach, not content strength) (account should have <5000 followers).
    2. Check the views. Is it actually viral?
    3. Confirm the format is trending right now.
    
    ![▪️](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/25aa.svg)
    
    S = Scalability
     
    - Can we recreate it ourselves at scale?
    - Can we do it consistently, creating enough to push across 5–10 accounts at once, multiple times a day?
    
    If not, skip it.
    
    ![▪️](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/25aa.svg)
    
    C = Convertibility 
     
    This is the most important.
    
    Go straight to the comments. Are people asking “What’s the app?” or “Where can I get this?”
    
    If yes → it’s viral that converts.
    
    That’s the VSC framework.
    
    Every piece of content we run has to pass it.
    
    Wrong way: post random trends hoping they stick.
    
    Right way: run VSC → choose proven viral → scale → convert into downloads.

- Phone prepare
    
    We’ve set up 50+ accounts by now, and f*cked up multiple times to figure out that getting the phone + tiktok account setup wrong will nuke your farm before it even starts.
    
    I learned this the hard way after accounts kept getting flagged. Turns out apple IDs, IPs, and even leftover device data messes it up if you’re sloppy - tiktok connects the dots.
    
    The right way? 
    
    Full reset → fresh Apple ID (no need for US sim) → disable auto app updates → Shadowrocket/HAPP proxy (always-on) → verify on BGP/BRDtest → then only download TikTok. 
    
    Finally, create account with Apple ID signup for max trust.
    
    If TikTok opens showing a profile, it’s carried over from the old Apple ID. Kill it. Reset again.

- Comment seeding
    
    “comment seeding” - best way to directly reach the communities you’re targeting.
    
    Why?
    1. Generated more trust for tiktok if you comment like a normal user.
    2. Allows you to increase presence in the aforementioned communities.
    3. Allows you to find creators (UGCs directly contact us after reading comments).
    
    How to?
    - Find posts going viral with less than 50 comments.
    - drop an organic comment promoting your product (promote your product, that’s the whole point of it)
    - real sauce: upvote the comment with your other accounts to boost it up
    
    ![🔥](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f525.svg)
    
- Hook
    
    We’ve tested over 50 hooks. This one still wins:
    
    "when you are no longer anxious about being connected with your partner
    
    ![😭](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f62d.svg)
    
    "
    
    (cue happy tears and the Flamme B-roll)
    
    That’s not just emotion - that’s an AI-generated UGC video that converts.
    
    At Flamme, we’ve been scaling hard on social lately.
    
    But unlike before, we’re no longer dependent on training creators, chasing content approvals, or battling inconsistency.
    
    We switched to AI UGC.
    
    And that changed the game.
    
    Now, we can test 10x more creatives with 10x less effort - and build our own models so our UGC feels proprietary, not generic.
    
    All of this became possible thanks to a tool built by a friend I deeply respect —
    
    [@zeeshaanl](https://x.com/zeeshaanl)
    
    — and his platform: theinfluencer . ai.
    
    Link’s in the comments (yes, it’s an affiliate link — but if you use it and love it, I’ll personally give back any earnings from it to you OR donate it to a charity of your choice).
    
    If you’re trying to scale social, skip the agency treadmill.
    
    Happy to share our full playbook, testing flows, and how we stack AI UGC + paid ads.

    (You actually need to consume more than you post.)
    
    Boom. That’s it.
    
    I posted 3 times back-to-back… but barely scrolled recently.
    So I spent the next 12 hours scrolling a bit here and there.
    And my posts started getting views again. Fewww.

    HERE IS HOW TO GET 1000S OF DOWNLOADS THIS MONTH TO YOUR APP FOR FREE:
    
    - if you are struggling to get downloads to your app then read this NOW, if you bookmark it, you aren't gunna take action on it... okay lets go.
    
    Open new account (instgram or tiktok first, or BOTH) scroll on it for 2 days, 15 min/day in your target audience. Save any videos you see that you could remake to promote your app (yes you'll need to think creatively for this)
    
    On day 3, make some content! Based on 1 of the saved videos you have.
    
    Make sure the comment, caption or end of video CTA is related/relevant to your app. If you just want views but no downloads, whats the use of this?
    
    Start with 1 post/ day and after 30 days of this if you didnt hit a reel with 500k views then feel free to DM me if you need help.
    
    Try to see what other apps are doing (can even look at mine) , and keep trying new formats, this is all about testing, but know that it IS POSSIBLE.

    Once you find a winning format, double down on it. Each apps "winning format" is unique and this may take more than a month to find a true winner. Took me 300+ videos for my app. Now i post 3 a day on one account and 2 a day on another.
    
    Don't rush into posting a million videos. Posting ONE a day that you have put reel creative thought into is much better than spraying out 2,3,4,5,6+ a day.
    
    Stick to 1 a day per warmed account (account that is new and you scrolled on without posting for 2 days in your target audience)
    
    Aim for short videos as algo LOVESSS watch time and comments. These are your two goals. MAKE content that drives comments and watch time
    
    What type of content drives these the best? GOOD CONTENT! not slop. You can go viral if you let yourself try hard enough and keep going. I know you can. and it will be a nice boost to your app downloads and revenue.

    okay now stop bookmarking this and just go do it, open a new account on tiktok/ instagram and warm it up.
    
    I prefer instagram as main, then reupload to YT, TT and all others at the same time via

    finally yes, the screenshot you see below is from my own tool post bridge. this is how ive been able to post AND MAKE 6 videos a day now after finding a winning format for my app that drives downloads. I upload and schedule all my apps content using this and it takes 10x less time!
    
    You can do the same for $9/ month (10x cheaper than the cheapest service out there for this same thing)

    HOW TO WARMUP ACOUNT RECAP:
    
    Make new account, scroll on it for 15 mins /day for 2-3 days. Scroll, follow, comment and like posts that YOUR APP or product is relevant to only. This helps the algorithm know where to push your content to first. This is CRITICAL for tiktok especially as its hard to change later. You should never buy Old accounts, they suck, and are very hard to warm up or change the existing set audience. I use same email for all my tiktok accounts, most little things dont matter like this. If you dont get views following this then its most likely your content is not that great. Keep trying, and don't be afraid to stop posting for 2-3 days if you cant break 500 view mark on TT or IG.
    
    OKAY NOW GO GO GO TRY IT!
