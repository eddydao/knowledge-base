# Project Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Framework (Completed)
- [x] Initial agent orchestration system setup.
- [x] Basic slash command implementation (`/plan`, `/fix`, `/test`).
- [x] Hook system for session management and security.
- [x] Integration with Obsidian vault.

## Phase 2: Enhanced Capabilities (Completed)
- [x] 17+ specialized subagents implemented and defined.
- [x] Advanced modular skill system (25+ skills).
- [x] Multimodal AI processing via Gemini API integration.
- [x] Codebase compaction using `repomix`.
- [x] Security-first lifecycle hooks (Privacy/Scout blocks).

## Phase 3: Developer Productivity (Current)
- [x] Automated documentation synchronization (`docs-manager`).
- [x] Hierarchical planning and subagent delegation protocols.
- [x] Obsidian Project Portfolio Dashboard (Phase 1 Foundation Setup Completed).
- [ ] Improved parallel execution management for subagents (In Progress).
- [ ] Web-based Kanban board for task tracking (`/kanban`).
- [ ] Automated environment bootstrap scripts for Mac/Windows.

## Phase 4: Scaling & Advanced Intelligence (Planned)
- [ ] Enhanced `code-reviewer` agent with deep architectural awareness.
- [ ] Automated onboarding and self-documentation for new subagents.
- [ ] Integration with external project management tools (Jira/Linear).
- [ ] Long-term memory persistence across disparate development sessions.

## Phase 5: Ecosystem & Deployment (Future)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline optimization and automated deployment workflows.
- [ ] Multi-user/Enterprise support (RBAC, SSO).
- [ ] Brag as a shared development service (API/Hosted).

## Milestones
- **M1: Core Stability**: 100% core workflow stability with comprehensive documentation.
- **M2: Skill Ecosystem**: 50+ unique modular skills available.
- **M3: Enterprise Readiness**: Production-grade security and multi-user support.

## Unresolved Questions
- Priority of web-based dashboard vs. CLI-only experience.
- Performance scaling for very large legacy codebases (>100k lines).
